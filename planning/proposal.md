# Kitty Health Tracker App
I want to build a fun health tracker that will keep a record of your daily health stats. Each item in the list will be separated by day, 
and it will have stats for mood, weight, bmi, blood pressure, heart rate, calorie intake, sleep, and notes. It will have an average of several
of the stats on the top of the page.

## MVP
The structure will be similar to what we have been doing with the quotes and to-do app. I will have a welcome page that takes you to the listing 
of daily health stats. Each day will have mood, hours of sleep, weight, bmi, blood pressure, heart rate, and calorie intake and the user
will be able go into each day and see all the stats displayed bigger on the screen, as well as any notes the user had input on that particular day.
On the stats index page, there will also be options on each day to edit or delete all the stats from that day. The edit option will take the user to
a new page where they can update their calorie intake, add some notes, or update any other stat they would like to change. Finally, back on the
stats index page, there will be a button to add a new day's stats, which will take the user to a new page where they can input all the fields.

## Post-MVP
Some features I would like to display would be to have the average of several of the inputs at the top of the stats index page that would adjust
based on any new inputs so that the user will be able to see their average weight, sleep time, bmi, blood pressure, etc. I would also like to use
the GIPHY API to have a bunch of funny cat GIFs all over the app. If I can't get the API to work, I'll use images.
